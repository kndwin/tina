	ANXIETY_AND_ME: {
		INTRO: `This bookcover was designed for Matthias Media for author Guan Un. The brief required a short turnover but I had creative freedom in the direction I thought best suited the books theme and content. 

I mainly used Procreate to draw the main illustration and drew inspiration from various different Japanese artists.
		`
		,INITIAL_DESIGN: `The feedback given was that the design did not stand out. In order to make it stand out, I decided to add more detail into the drawing. They thought the text in the orange one was effective in the way it tumbled down. This was also incoporated.`
		,ITERATION: `The font needed to be changed into something more readable and the sub heading made to look as if it were sinking into the whirpool.`
		,FINAL: `The final design came about after redrawing the main drawing many times. The whirpool design represents the authors own analogy of anxiety that he talks about in the first few chapters of the book. The sub-heading being pullled into the whirlpool, depicts the anxious thoughts spiralling out of control. `

	SPARX_LAB: {
		INTRO: `Sparx Lab, previously known as Spark Laboratories, is an innovative dental laboratory passionate about being on the forefront of technology in the dentistry industry. 

For this project, it required me to begin with the logo and create overall brand and visual identity. After this was established, the print and digital assets related to the industry.`
		,LOGO_ITERATION: `The ‘A’ missing the line was favoured and to further emphasise the technological aspect, the rest of the text was altered to look futurisic and modern.`
		,PAD_DESIGN: `The lab Pad is used by dental technicians and allows them to order the needed item for their patient. 

The lab pad needed to be comprehensive yet simple enough to be easily  navigated.`
